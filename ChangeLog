cvmfsexec-3.2 - 29 April 2020
- Change makedist without -s (that is, for cvmfsexec) to include fuse-libs
    for systems that do not have it.
- Change makedist to turn symlinks with full path targets into relative
    paths.  This was preventing singcvmfs from working on systems that
    didn't already have cvmfs installed.
- Remove the cvmfs mounting messages in singcvmfs that otherwise start
    happening with singularity-3.6.
- Change singcvmfs to send syslog messages to log/<reponame>.log.
- Add SINGCVMFS_LOGLEVEL=debug which enables debugging for singularity &
    cvmfs.  The cvmfs debug messages go to log/<reponame>-debug.log.

cvmfsexec-3.1 - 15 April 2020
- Change makedist to fail with better error messages when it can't 
    download packages it needs.
- Change makedist -s to download fuse3 from EPEL7 when on RHEL8, because
    the RHEL8.1 fuse3 version is too old and the fact that it moved to
    the base OS caused it to be removed from EPEL8.
- Change makedist to exclude .build-id files.
- Add "http://grid-wpad/wpad.dat;http://wpad/wpad.dat" to the beginning
    of the default Proxy Auto Config URLs.
- Change singcvmfs to set CVMFS_NFILES in a default.d config file, to
    avoid showing a cvmfs warning with singularity >= 3.6.

cvmfsexec-3.0 - 10 April 2020
- Add singcvmfs command and makedist -s option.
- Support unprivileged namespace fuse mounts in cvmfsexec on RHEL 7.8.

cvmfsexec-2.6 - 30 March 2020
- Avoid relocating OASIS_CERTIFICATES variable in oasis.opensciencegrid.org.

cvmfsexec-2.5 - 24 March 2020
- Exclude cvmfs-x509-helper-debug in makedist.

cvmfsexec-2.4 - 23 March 2020
- Add support in mountrepo for ". ../" in config files, as it is used in
    the EGI config repository for reading common.conf.

cvmfsexec-2.3 - 23 December 2019
- Fix support of cvmfs-2.7.0 by using its new CVMFS_LIBRARY_PATH.

cvmfsexec-2.2 - 4 December 2019
- allow multiple settings of CVMFS_CONFIG_REPOSITORY in default.d files.

cvmfsexec-2.1 - 9 October 2019
- Direct logs to per-repository files in "log" directory instead of syslog.
- Add makedist -o option to create one self-extracting script with the
    cvmfs distribution and cvmfsexec tools.

cvmfsexec-2.0 - 7 October 2019
- Take advantage of user namespace fuse mounts on kernels >= 4.18 (CentOS 8).
    This enables cleaning up mountpoints even with kill -9.
- Replace the $CVMFSEXEC interface with a simpler $CVMFSMOUNT/$CVMFSUMOUNT
    interface that also leaves no extra processes in the process tree.
- Always use --rbind instead of --bind when doing underlay mounts.
- Add cvmfs-x509-helper in makedist when it is present.

cvmfsexec-1.1 - 12 September 2019
- Preserve whitespace in parameters.
- Enable adding additional mounted repositories by invoking $CVMFSEXEC.
- Don't attempt to mount repositories that are already mounted.
- Always mount the config repository first.
- Enable cvmfs debug option when CVMFS_DEBUGLOG is set.

cvmfsexec-1.0 - 6 September 2019
- Initial release.
